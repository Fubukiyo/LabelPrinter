#Label Printer
This is a simple program that takes user input and prints it out using a Zebra label printer.

##Setup
All you need to do is download the exe from the bin folder above and run it, then input whatever you want made into a barcode. One thing to note is that this prints to your default printer, so it may not work as intended for people other than the computer it was designed for.

##Created by
This program was created by Jared Gabel, for a friend, to make his life easier.

##Using this program
If you want to use this program, feel free. Just don't make money off of it, call it yours, or any of those questionable things.
